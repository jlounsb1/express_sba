        title My Poe Build Tracker
    body 
        h1 So if I do a poe build tracking program, what pieces of information should i set up?
        ul
            li build information. I would put the information json in the data folder, then have a view and a route 
            li comments. I could have comments associated with the build, and set up a way to load them in when you select a certain build 
            li users? Maybe I could set up a space where you can set up users, so users can input their own builds and comment on others?
        p I am considering doing something similar for my final project.  In the game you can make custom hideouts, and import other peoples.  I could set up a app to organize, store, and share hideouts.
        p This is a simple version of the extensive site that uses poe's open api to display massive build information,
